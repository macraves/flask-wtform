### Genreal Info

The program is designed to perform CRUD work on the API. Since I expected that the given project would change every time,
I tried to add version control from beginning. It was really fun to encounter many tutorial problems in terms of version control.
I can't say it was a good control, but I got a lot of ideas to improve it.
