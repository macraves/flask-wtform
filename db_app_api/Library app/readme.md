# Flask Database and CRUD:

The aim of this work is to establish a database from scratch, prioritizing the creation of the 'users' table first, followed by 'authors', 'books' and 'posts' tables. Through connecting to this database via SQLAlchemy ORM, the goal is to perform CRUD operations using a Flask app through the designed front-end server. This project has followed the Flask and database relationship tutorials on the Codecademy.com YouTube channel. I would like to express my gratitude to Mr John for his informative videos in this regard.

In terms of HTML design, the WTForms package is an essential tool that significantly enhances the design using templates obtained from https://getbootstrap.com. Although I don't focus much on the front end, these packages in the requirements.txt file address any potential gaps to improve the project. Make sure to explore their documentation, as they are packages that simplify the process.

# Walkthroug:

The ability of each user to change  its own entry such as the book and block fields they added was mostly done with Jinja2 template applications so far. This application is based on HTML code and aims to improve HTML skills. The first user who is assigned ID 1 will be the admin and only the admin is able to change the author table content
